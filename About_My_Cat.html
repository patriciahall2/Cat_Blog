    <p>Eva is a 13 year old Siamese cat. She is very affectionate and meows a
    lot which is common for her breed.</p>
    <p>She is a rescue cat that has hyperthyroidism.
    She has to take medication twice a day with her meals.</p>
    <p>She is on a raw food diet and gets 2 meat nuggets per meal.  She eats twice a day.
    Once in the morning and once at night.</p>
    <p>She needs to take 1.5 pills with each meal.</p>
    <p>To give her her pills, open her mouth and put them in the back of her throat.
    Close her mouth then massage her throat to make her swallow.</p>
    <p> Make sure she doesn't spit them out. Once she's swallowed her pills
    allow her to eat her meal.</p>
    <p>She loves to play with strings, loves to be pet very gently, and loves to sleep
    with people.  Her purrs are very relaxing to listen to.</p>
